        title: Easily Customizable OCR for the Social Sciences 
        description: |

          EffOCR (**Eff**icient**OCR**) is designed for researchers and archives seeking a sample-efficient, customizable, 
          scalable OCR solution for diverse documents.

          Vast document collections remain trapped in hard copy or lack accurately digitized texts. 
          Using optical character recognition (OCR) to digitize public domain collections on a large scale entails several challenges:
          
          1. **Accuracy**. Digitized texts need to be sufficiently accurate for end users' objectives, which are highly diverse.
            Accuracy can be particularly central for quantitative applications, for which small errors can create major statistical outliers. 
            Models for lower resource languages, if they exist, tend to perform much worse than models for high resource settings like English.
          2. **Cost**. The OCR solution must be cheap to deploy, given document collections whose size numbers in the millions or even billions 
            of pages. Commercial engines - as well as large open-source OCR models - fall well short of this requirement.
            
          To meet these objectives, we developed EffOCR, an open-source OCR package designed for researchers, libraries, and archives seeking
           a computationally and sample efficient OCR solution for digitizing diverse document collections. EffOCR has two key ingredients: 
           1) a novel OCR architecture and 2) a carefully designed interface to facilitate off-the-shelf OCR usage, customization via model 
           training if necessary, and easy sharing of OCR models.

      - name: Architecture
        title: Efficient OCR Architecture
        description: |
          Modern OCR overwhelmingly uses deep neural networks - either a convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision transformer (ViT) - to encode images. 
          The representations created by passing an input image through a neural encoder are then decoded to the associated text. This approach is often
          referred to as "Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) OCR."

          In contrast, EffOCR brings OCR back to its roots: the _optical_ recognition of _characters_. Deep learning-based object detection methods are used to 
          localize individual characters in the document image. Character recognition is modeled as an image retrieval problem, using a vision encoder contrastively trained on character crops. 

          This figure compares the two approaches:

          title: Try a pretrained model
          description: |
            While Efficient OCR is primarily designed to be customized for _your_ dataset, we provide pretrained models for 
            experimentation. You can try out English inference with the following code snippet:

            ```python
            from efficient_ocr import EffOCR

            # English
            effocr = EffOCR(
              config={
                  'Recognizer': {
                      'char': {
                          'model_backend': 'onnx',
                          'model_dir': './models',
                          'hf_repo_id': 'dell-research-harvard/effocr_en/char_recognizer',
                      },
                      'word': {
                          'model_backend': 'onnx',
                          'model_dir': './models',
                          'hf_repo_id': 'dell-research-harvard/effocr_en/word_recognizer',
                      },
                  },
                  'Localizer': {
                      'model_dir': './models',
                      'hf_repo_id': 'dell-research-harvard/effocr_en',
                      'model_backend': 'onnx'
                  },
                  'Line': {
                      'model_dir': './models',
                      'hf_repo_id': 'dell-research-harvard/effocr_en',
                      'model_backend': 'onnx',
                  },
              }
            )

            results = effocr.infer(<path_to_image>.jpg)
            ```

          title: Sample Efficient Learning for Your Dataset
          description: |
            EffOCR is designed to be easily customized for your dataset. Shown only a handful of examples, it quickly adapts to new character sets, 
            languages, and document types. In the chart below, note EffOCR's high accuracy in both low- and high-resource settings:

            ![Efficient OCR Architecture](/assets/images/index/EffOCRAccuracy.png)

            EffOCR training can be performed either in an end-to-end fashion, as demonstrated [in this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cbd4Hq5V7lI6vvhQ8u8nm_jKU_LBdyVw?usp=sharing)
            or in a modular fashion, as demonstrated [in this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1190K39u4lQwSe1gB4MYrIVSSMknxQQCM?usp=sharing).

            Models in EffOCR are very lightweight, so training can nearly always be accomplished within a Colab notebook.
